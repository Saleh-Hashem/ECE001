<p><h3>One of the first things you hear when you start learning about coding are programming languages. They may sound technical and it’s hard to get a proper overview of them as a beginner. There’s just too much jargon flying around, so it’s normal to feel confused at this point.

To help you understand what programming languages are and what you can use them for, this part of our Free Coding Guide walks you through some programming language basics for beginners.

By the end of this part, you’ll know what programming languages can do for you, why there are so many to choose from, and how you’ll use them to build entire programs by coding.</p></h3>
<p><h3>Programming languages allow us to communicate with computers through computer code.

Each programming language is simply a means to tell a computer what it should do. It’s a language your computer understands and knows how to process.

When you learn a specific programming language, it’s a lot like learning any other language. You need to understand how the language works and follow a certain set of rules, much like grammar in spoken languages.

Each language is different and you’ll use them for different types of projects. We’ll come back to this in a minute.</h3></p>
